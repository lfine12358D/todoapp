# ToDo App
A fun throw away that demonstrates a simple implementation of a MVC4 Database First Entity Framework implmentation of a todo list
___
## create DB 
 Dont use the supplied createdb.sql without editing it first. It builds a catalog called CodeChallange. This will light up the schema. If the schema exists, dont run this.
## create tables
 apply createTables.sql

## Fire up the solution in VS2012 update 5
A build of the project should work fine.
The unit test should fail because there is no data.

## Run the app 
Add one or more entries

## Run Unit Tests
It should pass. The one test was to "plow the road" so more could be built easily.

## What's missing
I didn't get to finishing adding the bootstrap code and the css in the views.
